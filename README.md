# Compound Protocol OpenFrontEnd

OpenFrontEnds aims to make and maintain open source, self-contained, lite frontends for major decentralized finance protocols.

This repo is for an open source front end for the Compound Finance protocol and is a work in progress.

An open source frontend for Compound is the fist effort for OpenFrontEnds, but we have short term plans to fund interfaces for Aave, Maker, and Uniswap V3.
